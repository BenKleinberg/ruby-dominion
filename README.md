This game has two ways to view and interact: as a console application or as a window with a GUI. 

The console version only requires Ruby to run. To run the console version use:
'''
$ ruby src/BoardConsole.rb
'''

The GUI version requires JRuby to access the Java swing library. To run the GUI version use:
'''
$ jruby src/BoardGUI.rb
'''
